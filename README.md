## Dataset: Ford GoBike System Data

> Data consists of info about trips taken by service's members during february 2019,

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
>> Data wrangling process:
1-Fix multiple fields that are not in the correct data type, i.e. start_time, end_time, id columns, etc
2-Add new columns for the trip duration in minutes, member_age, and separate the day by name and day by hours

## Summary of Findings

> The number of trips peaked during the morning and evening rush hours, with more trips occurring on weekdays than weekends. Trips on weekdays were also shorter than trips on weekends. This suggests that the bike-sharing system is used more efficiently for commuting on weekdays, while it is used more casually and flexibly on weekends.


> The majority of riders were male subscribers who used the bike-sharing system for a subset of their trips. Most members were between 20 and 45 years old, with a significant drop in usage for older riders. Male riders tend to have shorter trips than female riders, as indicated by the smaller median and shorter interquartile range. Riders who rented bikes on weekdays were slightly older than those who rented on weekends, which is consistent with the observation that weekdays are more likely to be used for commuting.

> Subscribers are the primary users of the bike-sharing system, and their riding patterns are significantly different from those of customers. Subscribers use the bikes primarily for commuting to work, which is why most of their trips occur on weekdays during rush hours. Customers, on the other hand, tend to use the bikes for leisure purposes, such as riding for fun or exercise, which is why their trips are more evenly distributed throughout the week and are more likely to occur in the afternoon or early evening on weekends. The peak usage of subscribers during rush hours further confirms their purpose of using the bike-sharing system for commuting. In contrast, the different pattern of customer usage suggests that they use the bikes for different purposes.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> The exploration reveals that subscribers and customers have different usage patterns. Subscribers use the system heavily on weekdays, while customers ride more on weekends, especially in the afternoon. Subscribers tend to make many trips around 8-9 am and 5-6 pm on weekdays, while customers tend to use the system more in the late afternoon around 5 pm on weekdays. The efficient and short usage periods for subscribers correspond to their high concentration in rush hours on weekdays, which suggests that they primarily use the bikes for commuting to work. The more relaxed and flexible usage patterns for customers show that they use the system differently, with heavier usage on weekends and in the afternoon, possibly for city tours or leisure purposes.
